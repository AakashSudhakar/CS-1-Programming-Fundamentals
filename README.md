course.

This course is designed to help students with beginner-level coding experience master
the fundamentals of coding and Computer Science, so that they will be well-equipped to
get the most out of all the other courses they'll take at Make School. This course will cover
the foundations of Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming, functions and recursion, debugging,
best practices for solving problems, and how to write clean, structured code.  

### Who should enroll (optional)

Students in the Product College come with varying levels of experience in coding and Computer Science.  
Some students may have already gained the knowledge and skills found in this course in their studies
prior to enrollment.  As a result, we have created a diagnostic exam to help students determine if this
course is right for them.
